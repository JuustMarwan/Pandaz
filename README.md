# **Pandaz**
**The Official Core System For MCPE Practice Server Pandaz.**

I developed this core for the intention of private use, so everything is hard coded. I suggest understanding [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) before attempting to make changes.

Enjoy. ❤️️
